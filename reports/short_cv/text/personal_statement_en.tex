I am a scientific researcher passionate about understanding the motion planning algorithms that involve active sensing. My training as an engineer and scientist has allowed me to propose, analyze and implement state-of-the-art solutions for several theoretical and practical problems. My current research interests include deep learning-based computer vision, robot motion planning, autonomous 3D reconstruction, and autonomous surface inspection.
